        **Please read if you wish to raise a version compatibility issue**
        This project is constantly being updated for new Minecraft compatibility, including snapshot versions.
        If you wish to play with a newer version, please check the current version has no compatibility with the target version. In some cases, it may work with different minor versions.
        And please make sure that the target version does not exist in GitHub tags and Maven.
        Also, the artifacts generated by GitHub actions may still be available.
        Please search from the link below:
